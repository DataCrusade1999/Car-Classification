# Car-Classification
Here full-featured automatic system for vehicle detection, tracking and license plate recognition is presented. This system has many applications in pattern recognition and machine vision and they ranges from complex security systems to common areas and from parking admission to urban traffic control. This system has complex characteristics due to diverse effects as fog, rain, shadows, uneven illumination conditions, occlusion, variable distances, velocity of car, scene's angle in frame, rotation of plate, number of vehicles in the scene and others. The main objective of this work is to show a system that solves the practical problem of car identification for real scenes. All steps of the process, from video acquisition to optical character recognition are considered to achieve an automatic identification of plates.
