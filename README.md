# Car-Classification
We're trying to make full-featured automatic vehicle damage detection system.This system has many applications in machine vision. The main objective of this work is to show a system that solves the practical problem of car damage detection for real scenes. All steps of the process, from data acquisition to damage detection are considered to achieve good result.
