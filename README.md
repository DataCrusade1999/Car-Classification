We're trying to make full-featured automatic vehicle damage detection system.This system has many applications in Computer vision and also in fault detection.The main objective of this work is to show a system that solves the practical problem of car damage detection for real scenes. All steps of the process, from data acquisition to damage detection are considered to achieve good result.
